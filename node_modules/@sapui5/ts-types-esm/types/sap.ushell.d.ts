   *
   * The Unified Shell's CrossApplicationNavigation service allows to navigate to "external" targets outside
   * of the currently running app (but still in scope of the current Fiori launchpad) or create links to such
   * external targets.
   *
   * To use the CrossApplicationNavigation service you can retrieve an instance via ushell's Container:
   * ```javascript
   *
   * sap.ushell.Container.getServiceAsync("CrossApplicationNavigation").then(function (CrossApplicationNavigationService) {
   *   // Use the CrossApplicationNavigation service
   * });
   * ```
   *
   *
   * The CrossApplicationNavigation service currently provides platform independent functionality.
   *
   * The service is meant to be used by applications, plugins and shell components.
   *
   * Usage:
   * ```javascript
   *
   *   sap.ushell.Container.getServiceAsync("CrossApplicationNavigation").then( function (oService) {
   *
   *      oService.hrefForExternalAsync({
   *          target : {
   *              semanticObject: "Product",
   *              action: "display"
   *          },
   *          params: {
   *              "ProductID": "102343333"
   *          }
   *      }).then( function(sHref) {
   *          // Place sHref somewhere in the DOM
   *      });
   *   });
   *   ```
   *
   *
   * Parameter names and values are case sensitive.
   *
   * Note that the usage of multi-valued parameters (specifying an array with more than one member as parameter
   * value, e.g. `params : { A : ["a1", "a2"] }`) is possible with this API but **strongly discouraged**.
   * Depending on the used platform / back-end implementation the target matching might not supported multi-value
   * parameters. Furthermore, it is not guaranteed that additional parameter values specified in the back-end
   * configuration are merged with parameter values passed in this method.
   *
   * Note that the application parameter length (including SemanticObject/Action) shall not exceed 512 bytes
   * when serialized as UTF-8.
   *
   * Note that when receiving the values as startup parameters (as part of the component data object) single
   * values are represented as an array of size 1. Above example is returned as ` deepEqual(getComponentData().startupParameters
   * , { "ProductID" : [ "102343333" ] } ) `
   *
   * Make sure not to store security critical data within an URL. URLs may appear in a server log, be persisted
   * inside and outside the system.
   *
   * Note: When constructing large URLs, the URLs may be shortened and persisted on a database server for
   * prolonged time, the actual data is persisted under a key accessible to any User (guessing the key).
   *
   * The same restrictions apply for the Application state.

       *   }
       *   ```
       *
       *
       * When the parameter is expressed in this format, the caller can specify additional search options.
       *
       * Besides 'value', supported search options for the extended format are:
       * 	 **required**: whether the parameter must be required (true) or not required (false) in the signature
       * of the matching target (once the navigation occurs to the returned link). Please note that this option
       * will be effective if the Fiori Launchpad is configured to resolve navigation targets via `sap.ushell.services.ClientSideTargetResolution`
       * and therefore may not be supported in all platforms.
       *
       * Example:
       * ```javascript
       *
       *         ...
       *         params: {
       *           P1: { value: "v1", required: true },

       *         }
       *         ...
       *       ```
       *
       *
       * This method supports a mass invocation interface to obtain multiple results with a single call, as
       * shown in the following example:
       *
       *
       * ```javascript
       *
       *     oCrossApplicationService.getLinks([ // array, because multiple invocations are to be made
       *        [                           // arguments for the first invocation
       *          { semanticObject: "SO" }  // this method supports one parameter only in each call

       * object.
       *
       * **Note:** Parameter values can contain special characters and must be provided unencoded; the function
       * takes care for necessary encodings itself.
       *
       * Simple Example:
       * ```javascript
       *
       * {
       *   target: {
       *     semanticObject: "Customer",

       *     customerId: "0815-4711"
       *   }
       * }
       * ```
       *
       *
       * Example with text:
       * ```javascript
       *
       * {
       *   target: {
       *     semanticObject: "Note",
       *     action: "create"
       *   },
       *   params: {
       *     noteText: "Thanks for reading the documentation!"
       *   }
       * }
       * ```
       *
       *
       * Example with a given context:
       * ```javascript
       *
       * {
       *   target: {
       *     semanticObject: "AnObject",
       *     action: "action",
       *     context: "AB7F3C"

       *     param1: "Value One"
       *   }
       * }
       * ```
       *
       *
       * Alternatively a `shellHash` can be provided that includes already all aspects of the navigation target:
       * semantic object, action, intent parameters, app-specific route (including app parameters)
       *
       * **Note:** While parameters need to be url-encoded once when used in the `shellHash` the app specific
       * route must not be encoded.
       *
       * Example with shellHash as target:
       * ```javascript
       *
       * {
       *   target: {
       *     shellHash: "Note-update?noteText=You%20got%20quite%20far&/Notes/My First Note"
       *   }
       * }
       * ```
       *
       *
       * To navigate to the homepage of the Fiori launchpad, navigate to `{target: {shellHash: "#"}}`. Do not
       * use "#Shell-home" or "Shell-home" to navigate to!
       *
       * To provide a complex parameter structure to a target app the pseudo parameter `sap-xapp-state-data` can
       * be used.
       *
       * Example:
       * ```javascript
       *
       * {
       *   ...
       *   params : {
       *     "sap-xapp-state-data": JSON.stringify({ a: "b", c: "d" })
       *   }
       * }
       * ```
       *
       *
       * The data specified via `sap-xapp-state-data` is passed to the target application in the `sap-xapp-state`
       * parameter. The `sap-xapp-state-data` parameter itself is not passed to the target application.
       *
       * **Note:** The parameter length (including semantic object and action) shall not exceed 512 bytes when
       * serialized as UTF-8.

     * validity indicates that data is persisted in the Personalization data of the front-end server. A round
     * trip is executed on an initial get and at least every save operation. Data is stored per user and retained
     * indefinitely at the front-end server.
     *
     * The validity parameter allows a designated storage validity for the created container. A 0 validity indicates
     * the data is only persisted within the Fiori launchpad window. No round trips to the front-end server
     * are executed. Data is lost if the Fiori launchpad window state is lost (e.g. by navigating to a different
     * page, pressing F5 (reload page) or duplicating the window).
     *
     * For versions > 1.24 it may happen that for cross-app navigation a reload of the Fiori launchpad is triggered.
     * In this case a storage of the personalization data in the Fiori launchpad window would lead to data loss.
     * To overcome this a validity 0 is automatically changed to a validity 1440 (24h; storage on the front-end
     * server). This is only done if a reload of the Fiori launchpad is triggered for a cross-app navigation.
     *
     * Security: It is the responsibility of the application to not persist information relevant to auditing
     * or security using the PersonalizationService with inappropriate validity models. No mechanisms exist
     * to destroy or selectively destroy application-specific data in the front-end server persistence (especially
     * for validity Infinity).
     *
     * For non-zero validity scopes, data will be transmitted and persisted in the front-end server system.
     *
     * For limited validity, actual deletion of data on the front-end server is subject to explicit cleanup
     * execution of front-end server jobs and not guaranteed. The data may still be persisted and retrievable.
     * The interface only assures that expired data is no longer exposed to the application code in the Fiori
     * launchpad.
     *
     * The ContainerKey uniquely defines the Container, validity is not part of the key (there are no separate
     * namespaces per validity).
     *
     * In general, mixing different validity models for a given container key is not supported. Fast chaining
     * of different methods may source arbitrary persistence layers. The validity of the resulting object in
     * the done function of a promise is the last get validity.
     *
     * The validity associated with the last getContainer or createEmptyContainer determines the current validity
     * of the container and the validity used during the next save operation.
     *
     * Naturally, if a delete or get with validity 0 is issued, it will *not* delete or retrieve a front-end
     * server persistent storage. Thus a sequence delete( [validity 0])/wait for promise, getContainer(sKey,{

       * The Unified Shell's ShellUIService service.
       *
       * This service allows apps to interact with the Fiori Launchpad UI. The service is injected in the app
       * components by the FLP renderer before the corresponding apps start. To consume the service, app components
       * should declare it in their manifest.json as follows:
       *
       *
       * ```javascript
       *
       * {
       *    ...
       *    "sap.ui5": {
       *       "services" : {
       *          "ShellUIService": {
       *              "factoryName": "sap.ushell.ui5service.ShellUIService"
       *          }
       *       }
       *    }
       *    ...
       * }
       * ```
       *
       *
       * The service can be then retrieved and consumed from the app root component as in the following example:
       *
       * ```javascript
       *
       * // Component.js (the app root component)
       * ...
       * this.getServiceAsync("ShellUIService").then( // promise is returned
       *    function (oService) {
       *       oService.setTitle("Application Title");
       *    },
       *    function (oError) {
       *       Log.error("Cannot get ShellUIService", oError, "my.app.Component");
       *    }
       * );
       * ...
       * ```
       *
       *
       * The ShellUIService can work together with the routing defined in a UI5 app to set title and hierarchy
       * automatically, as the navigation within the app occurs. This can be achieved by enabling the ShellUIService
       * to load instantly and configuring one or both `setTitle` and `setHierarchy` options to `auto` in the
       * app manifest, as shown in the example below:
       *
       *
       * ```javascript
       *
       * {
       *    "sap.ui5": {
       *       "services" : {
       *          "ShellUIService": {
       *              "lazy": false,
       *              "factoryName": "sap.ushell.ui5service.ShellUIService",
       *              "settings": {
       *                  "setHierarchy": "auto",
       *                  "setTitle": "auto"
       *              }
       *          }
       *       }
       *    }
       * }
       * ```
       *
       *
       * Please note that the `setHierarchy` or `setTitle` methods should not be actively called by the application
       * when title and hierarchy are set automatically.
       *
       * **Note:** Please be aware that the sapFiori2Adaptation configuration of the application may cause the
       * ShellUIService service to work incorrectly. We recommend to disable the sapFiori2Adaptation configuration
       * for the new applications if you use ShellUIService.
