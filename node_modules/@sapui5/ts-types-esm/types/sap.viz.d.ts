     * ```javascript
     *
     * selectData: function(oEvent) {
     *   var aSelectData = oEvent.getParameter("data");
     *   var oContext = this.getDataset().findContext(aSelectData[0].data[0].ctx.path);
     * }
     * ```
     *  Example when use sap.viz.ui5.controls.VizFrame:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * selectData: function(oEvent) {
     *   var aSelectData = oEvent.getParameter("data");
     *   var oContext = this.getDataset().findContext(aSelectData[0].data);

   * @deprecated (since 1.32.0) - The chart controls in the `sap.viz.ui5` package (which were always marked
   * as experimental) have been deprecated since 1.32.0. They are no longer actively developed and
   * won't receive new features or improvements, only important bug fixes. They will only remain in the SAPUI5
   * distribution for backward compatibility.
   *
   * **SAP strongly recommends that existing consumers of those controls migrate to the new {@link sap.viz.ui5.controls.VizFrame VizFrame}**(`new
   * sap.viz.ui5.controls.VizFrame({'vizType': '100_dual_stacked_column'})`) **control to benefit from new
   * charting enhancements and timely support. **
   *
   * **Note**: As the feature set, design and API usage of VizFrame might differ from the old chart controls,
   * make sure you evaluate it thoroughly before migration.
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.7.2) - Charting API is not finished yet and might change completely.
